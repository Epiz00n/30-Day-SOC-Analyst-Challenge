# 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge (Work in Progress)

This is an in-progress, cloud-based cybersecurity lab designed to simulate real-world detection and response workflows in a SOC environment. The project follows the 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge and includes log ingestion, threat detection, alerting, incident response, and ticketing integration—all built using the ELK Stack, Mythic C2, Elastic Defend, and osTicket.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This hands-on lab mirrors key responsibilities of a SOC analyst and is designed to help bridge the gap between cybersecurity theory and real-world practice. All infrastructure is built in the cloud via Vultr to simulate a scalable, production-style environment.

### Key Features
- **ELK Stack Setup** – Ingest logs, configure dashboards, and build alerts  
- **Threat Simulation** – SSH/RDP brute-force and C2 activity using Mythic  
- **Incident Response** – Triage alerts and track investigations via osTicket  
- **Cloud Infrastructure** – Deployed on Vultr using Windows and Linux VMs
